Add_Timestamp_Watermark_To_Image_Using_Php-Imagick

Builds timestamp image file and you need to have your backround file in same directory as monkey template images is. You can change bg name, but avoid changing image format because malfunction possible get errors because of that.

This was my idea first to set http://anothersearchengine.dy.fi timestamper image. There was user controlled monkey image some time ago on my site there was comment input form and text append to monkey second transparent layer top to down in center of image.

I would build that again, because dataloss. I upload code then here github.
